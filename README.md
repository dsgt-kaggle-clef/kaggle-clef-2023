# kaggle-clef-fall23

This repository is to track progress of projects done in the [Kaggle-CLEF competition group][proposal] with the Data Science at Georgia Tech club (DS@GT).

This is effectively a mono-repo to keep track of working notes.
Every member has a user directory prefixed with the users gatech (or github) handle.
For example, the directory for @acmiyaguchi is `users/acmiyaguchi`.

All changes should be made on separate branches, and merged via pull requests onto the main branch.
The separate user directories should prevent most conflicts, but there may be useful shared utilities that can be placed into a centralized directory.
